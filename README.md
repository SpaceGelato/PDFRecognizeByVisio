# PDFRecognizeByVisio

This is a personal project and experimental playground for text recognition. The app utilizes PDFKit for document handling. When the filter option is toggled, it triggers image zoom-in by a specific factor, along with the application of blurring with an adjustable coefficient.

This project serves as a testbed for exploring the Visio framework's capabilities, specifically in the context of text recognition. It's worth noting that the effectiveness of this method may vary based on the language being processed, including English.
